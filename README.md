# INTL
INTL, pronounced "international" or I-N-T-L, is an website geared towards the international student community at the University of Washington and the greater Seattle area. We hope to create a place where international students can gather and create a community online. Our site is meant to act as a starting point for an international student to look into legislation, news, and connecting with others in similar situations.

Users can browse resources or news without an account, but can only read/post to discussions and events with an account.

The tools we provide to accomplish this goal:

* Resources page: for students to look for more people to contact or more ways to get involved in the community
* News feed: a feed that takes news from the NY Times developer API that focuses on immigration stories and other stories that may interest our audience
* Discussion board: where students can voice opinions, ask questions, or just throw some ideas out there for their peers to read and respond to
* Events: if a user of the website has an event that they want to share with others using the website's community, they can post it to the events page. Other users can browse these events to look for more opportunities to further get involved.

To create this application, we used React, Firebase, Material UI, and Material Design Lite.
